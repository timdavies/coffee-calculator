# Coffee Calculator

Coffee Calculator is my first iOS app. It's quite simple, only took a few hours to make, but I use it daily and it's quite helpful if you're picky about coffee.

It helps you calculate how much coffee to add to x amount of water, or vice-versa. It also has a timer ready, set to 4 minutes, so you don't leave your coffee brewing for too long.

Feel free to build it for your device if you have a developer license. [Otherwise, you can buy it on the App Store for 69p here.](https://itunes.apple.com/app/coffee-calculator-for-cafetieres/id951940182)

Here's what it looks like:

The current icon is awful. Would be great to replace it with something better at some point.
